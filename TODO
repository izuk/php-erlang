PHP/Erlang

TODO

* Better error checking in erlang_term().
* Better error checking in erlang_extract().
* Implement ~w in erlang_term().
* Shortcuts for erlang_send() and erlang_receive() so you don't need
  to use erlang_term() and erlang_extract().
* Maybe support multiple nodes.  Maybe.

BUGS

* ~t doesn't work in erlang_term().

CAUTION

If you don't call erlang_receive() every minute or so to respond to
TICK messages, the Erlang side thinks you've timed out and
disconnects you.  erlang_init() handles this, so if you suspect that
your PHP code will be busy doing something for more than 1 minute,
you *must* call erlang_init() again before trying to use the other
erlang functions, and at that point you'll have a new PID.
